There are three collections in the database: 'employees', 'countries', and 'departments', with a one-to-many relation between them.

When adding or editing, only the title is required. The missing parts will be generated with random data from a third-party API. You can select a department or country from the dropdown menu. If the value doesn't exist, it will be added to the corresponding collection.
